# Linked lists in python
# Definition: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference.
